      Development on a third Deadpool film began at 20th Century Fox by November 2016,
      but was placed on hold after the studio was acquired by Disney in March 2019.
      Control of the character and Fox's X-Men film series was transferred to Marvel
      Studios, which began developing a new film with Reynolds.
      It integrates Deadpool with the MCU and retains the R rating of the previous
      Deadpool films, a first for the MCU.
      Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin joined in November 2020 as writers.
      Reese and Wernick returned from the previous films for rewrites by March 2022,
      when Levy was hired as director. They, along with Reynolds and Wells,
      had difficulty figuring out the film's story until Jackman decided
      to reprise his role as Wolverine from the X-Men films in August 2022.
      Several other actors from the X-Men films and other Marvel productions
      also returned as part of the film's multiverse story, which serves as a tribute
      to Fox's Marvel films. Filming began in May 2023 at Pinewood
      Studios in England, with additional filming in Norfolk, Los Angeles, and at
      Bovingdon Film Studios. Production was suspended in July due to
      the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, but resumed in November and wrapped in January 2024.
      The title was revealed a month later.
